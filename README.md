## 3. Approach & Challenges

### **Problem-Solving Approach & Decision-Making**
To ensure a smooth and interactive quiz experience, key decisions were made:
- **State Management:** Zustand was chosen for its lightweight and efficient state handling, ensuring global quiz state (answers, progress) remains synchronized.
- **Navigation:** Expo Router was selected for seamless navigation, with the back button blocked using `BackHandler` to prevent users from accidentally leaving the quiz.
- **UI/UX Design:**
  - Dynamic styling for correct/incorrect answers (green/red highlights) improves user feedback.
  - A progress bar was implemented to help users track their completion status.
  - Clear, color-coded result breakdown to enhance user engagement.

### **Challenges & How They Were Handled**
‚úÖ **Solved Challenges:**
- **Smooth State Management:** Zustand provided an efficient way to maintain quiz state across screens without unnecessary re-renders.
- **Answer Validation & Feedback:** Immediate answer validation was implemented using dynamic styling, offering real-time feedback.
- **Navigation Constraints:** The back button was disabled during the quiz to prevent accidental exits.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Unsolved Edge Cases & Future Improvements:**
- **Network Resilience:** Currently, the app is local-only, but future versions could integrate API-driven quizzes, requiring error handling for network failures.
- **Timer for Questions:** A countdown timer per question could improve engagement but is not yet implemented.
- **More Quizzes & Question Types:** Future enhancements could support different quiz formats like multiple-choice or timed quizzes.

### **Code Quality & Implementation Strategy**
- **Modular Components:** The app follows a structured component-based approach, making it scalable and maintainable.
- **Efficient State Handling:** Zustand ensures minimal re-renders, keeping the app performant.
- **Styling & UI Best Practices:** The UI maintains a native feel with a clean and user-friendly design.
